## (Anticipated) FAQs

### What happened to Overleaf?
Although the live-editing of Overleaf was incredibly helpful in getting started,
as the number of contributors has grown into the double-digits,
conflicting work and people overwriting others' changes has become more of an issue.
I've moved the repo over to Git to help reduce this issue.
This also helps reduce the project's dependence on a single platform,
and lets contributors use whatever editor they want.

### Where's the sheets for year 1?
I used separate Overleaf documents for courses in 1st year, so they haven't been added to the repo.
If you'd really want to see them here, bug me on Discord.

### I worked on this when it was still on Overleaf. Why is my contribution not credited?
Sadly, Overleaf's sync process doesn't transfer over contributor details.
(I'm as dissapointed as you, I literally couldn't have done this without the community)
If you don't plan on contributing through GitHub but still want your name attached to the project,
please DM me on Discord and I'll add your name to this README.
