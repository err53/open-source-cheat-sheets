  \subsection{Syntax}
  \begin{lstlisting}
// instance prefixing - a:P
SWITCH = (on -> off -> SWITCH).
||TWO_SWITCH = (a:SWITCH || b:SWITCH).

// relabeling - /{new1/old1, new2/old2, ...}.
CLIENT = (call -> wait -> continue -> CLIENT).
SERVER = (request -> service -> reply -> SERVER).
||CLIENT_SERVER = (CLIENT||SERVER)/{call/request,reply/wait}.

// process prefixing (mutex) - {a1, ..., ax} :: P
RESOURCE = (acquire -> release -> RESOURCE).
USER = (acquire -> user -> release -> USER).
||RESOURCE_SHARE = (a:USER || b:USER || {a, b}::RESOURCE).
// RESOURCE is a single shared instance between the two USERs

// for loop syntax
|| SWITCHES (N = 3) = (forall [i:1..N] s[i]:SWITCH)
// or alternatively
range Seats = 1..3
|| SEATS=(seat[i:1..3]:SEAT).

// hiding operator - \{a1, ..., ax}
// interface operator - @{a1, ..., ax}
// these two do the same thing
USER = (acquire -> use -> release -> USER)\{use}.
USER = (acquire -> use -> release -> USER)@{acquire, release}.

// syntax for progress
progress P = {a1, ..., an}

// syntax for high priority
||C = (P||Q)<<{a1, ..., an}.
// syntax for low priority
||C = (P||Q)>>{a1, ..., an}.

// simulating a boolean
const False = 0
const True  = 1
range Bool  = 0..1
\end{lstlisting}

  Maker-user example
  \begin{lstlisting}
MAKER = (make -> ready -> MAKER).
USER  = (ready -> user -> USER).
||MAKER_USER = (MAKER || USER).
\end{lstlisting}

  Garden example (maybe move this to a diff section later)
  \begin{lstlisting}
const N = 4
range T = 0..N
set VarAlpha = {value.{read[T],write[T]}}

VAR      = VAR[0],
VAR[u:T] = (read[u]   ->VAR[u] 
           |write[v:T]->VAR[v]).

TURNSTILE = (go    -> RUN),
RUN       = (arrive-> INCREMENT
            |end   -> TURNSTILE),
INCREMENT = (value.read[x:T]
            ->value.write[x+1]->RUN)
            +VarAlpha.

DISPLAY =(value.read[T]->DISPLAY)+{value.write[T]}.

||GARDEN = (east:TURNSTILE || west:TURNSTILE || display:DISPLAY
           || {east,west,display}::value:VAR)
            /{go /{east,west}.go,
              end/{east,west}.end}.
\end{lstlisting}

  \section{LTS}
  % TODO: This can probably be deleted, seems pretty trivial
  % Maybe replace with crucial examples?
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lts-example.png}

  \section{Petri Nets}

  \subsection{Reachability Graphs}
  % TODO: this image is really small and probably won't print well
  % if we have time, refactor it...
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{reachability_graph.png}

  \section{Hiding/Labeling}
  \textbf{relabeling:} (PROCESS)/$\{newlabel1/oldlabel1, ... , newlabeln/oldlabeln\}$\\
  \textbf{interface:} (PROCESS)@$\{a1 . . . ax\}$ hides all actions except a1 . . . ax\\
  \textbf{hiding:} (PROCESS) \textbackslash  $\{a1...an\}$ hides actions a1...an\\

  $\{a1, . . . , ax\}$ :: P replaces every action label n in the alphabet
  of P with the labels a1.n, ... , ax.n. Thus, every transition
  (n â†’ X) in the definition of P is replaced with the transitions
  $(\{a1.n, . . . , ax.n\} \xrightarrow{} X)$

  \section{Bisimulation}
  \textbf{State Bisimilarity} -- $p \approx q$ iff whatever action executed at $p$ can also be executed at $q$, and vice versa.

  \textbf{LTS Bisimilarity} -- $P \approx Q$ iff each state $p_t$, reachable from the initial state by a trace $t$ in $P$ is bisimilar to an appropriate state $q_t$ that is reachable from the initial state by the same trace $t$ in $Q$.

  % \section{Structure Diagrams}
  % \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sd.png}
  %     \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{sd-printer.png}
  % \end{center}
  % \begin{lstlisting}
  % RESOURCE = (acquire -> release -> RESOURCE).
  % USER =     (printer.acquire->use->printer.release->USER)\{use}.

  % ||PRINTER_SHARE
  %     = (a:USER||b:USER||{a,b}::printer:RESOURCE).
  % \end{lstlisting}

  \section{Mutual Exclusion}
  Arbitrary interleaving of read and write actions leads to \textbf{interference}.
  Interference bugs are difficult to locate.
  We use \textbf{mutual exclusion} to only give one process access to the shared resource at a time.

  \begin{lstlisting}
LOCK = (acquire->release->LOCK).
U1 = (acquire -> use -> release -> U1).
U2 = (acquire -> use -> release -> U2).
||SYSTEM = (u1:U1||u2:U2||{u1,u2}::LOCK).
\end{lstlisting}
  Above allows for lock$\xrightarrow{}$use$\xrightarrow{}$release for either user but only one of them at a time.

  \section{Monitors and Semaphores}
  \textbf{Monitor} -- A threadsafe class where each function is wrapped by a mutex. Essentially, only one process may access the class at a time. Entirely syntactic sugar.
  \textbf{Semaphore} -- Essentially a mutex with a queue of processes

  \begin{lstlisting}
down(s):    if s > 0 then
                decrement s
            else
                block execution of calling process
up(s):      if processes blocked on s then
                awaken one of them
            else
                increment s
\end{lstlisting}

  \begin{lstlisting}
const Max = 3
range Int = 0..Max

SEMAPHORE(N=0) = SEMA[N],
SEMA[v:Int]    = (up->SEMA[v+1]
                 |when(v>0) down->SEMA[v-1]
                 ).

LOOP = (mutex.down -> critical -> mutex.up -> LOOP).

||SEMADEMO = (p[1..3]:LOOP || {p[1..3]}::mutex:SEMAPHORE(1)).
\end{lstlisting}
  \section{Bounded Buffer}
  A buffer with a fixed number of slots
  \begin{lstlisting}
BUFFER(N=5) = COUNT[0],
COUNT[i:0..N]
    = (when (i<N) put->COUNT[i+1]
      |when (i>0) get->COUNT[i-1]
      ).
PRODUCER = (put->PRODUCER).
CONSUMER = (get->CONSUMER).

||BOUNDEDBUFFER = (PRODUCER||BUFFER(5)||CONSUMER).
\end{lstlisting}
  \subsection{Nested Monitor Problem}
  \section{P/T nets}
  Each place in a P/T net can hold multiple tokens. Each transition has a weight, w, associated with it. If it is an input transition, firing takes w tokens from the input place. If its an output transition, firing adds w tokens to the output place. An action can only be fired if enough input tokens are present in all input places.
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{ptnet.png}
  \section{Deadlocks}
  \subsection{Dining Philosophers Problem}
  Simple minded construction:
  \begin{lstlisting}
FORK = (get -> put -> FORK).
PHIL = (think -> right.get -> left.get -> eat -> right.put -> left.put -> PHIL).
||DINERS(N = 5) = forall[i : 1..N] (phil[i] : PHIL || {phil[i].right, phil[(i % 5) + 1].left} :: FORK
\end{lstlisting}

  \textbf{Solution 1} -- Add asymmetry into the composition, where 1, 3, 5 always perform `left.get -> right.get',
  while 2, 4 always perform `right.get -> left.get'.
  \begin{lstlisting}
PHIL = (when(i=1|i=3|i=5) think -> left.get -> right.get -> eat -> left.put -> right.put -> PHIL
       |when(i=2|i=4) think -> right.get -> left.get -> eat -> right.put -> left.put -> PHIL).
\end{lstlisting}

  \textbf{Solution 2} -- Use a butler to prevent more than 4 philosophers from sitting at the table.
  \begin{lstlisting}
PHIL = (think -> sitdown -> right.get -> left.get -> eat -> right.put -> left.put -> getup -> PHIL).
BUTLER(K=4) = COUNT[0],
COUNT[i:1..4] = (when(i<K) sitdown -> COUNT[i+1] | getup -> COUNT[i-1]).
||DINERS(N=5) ...
||{phil[i:1..N]}::BUTLER(K=4)).
\end{lstlisting}

  \textbf{Solution 3} -- Use Simultaneity
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{phil-sim.png}
  Only fire a transition if both forks are available

  \section{Coloured Petri Nets}
  ``Colours'' are simply types of tokens that are passed around the petri net
  Paths to transitions are either labeled with variables or functions that transform one of the input variables into the object to remove from a state.

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diners-cpn.png}
  \begin{lstlisting}
colour PH = with ph1 | ph2 | ph3 | ph4 | ph5
colour Fork = with f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5
LEFT : PH -> FORK, RIGHT : PH -> FORK
var x : PH
fun LEFT x = case of ph1 => f2 | ph2 => f3 | ph3 => f4 | ph4 => f5 | ph5 => f1
fun RIGHT x = case of ph1 => f1 | ph2 => f2 | ph3 => f3 | ph4 => f4 | ph5 => f5
\end{lstlisting}

  \section{Semaphores and Extensions}
  \subsection{Dijkstra's Semaphore Operations}
  \textbf{C(s)} -- initial value of a semaphore variable $s$
  \textbf{ndown(s)} -- number of times down(s) was executed
  \textbf{nup(s)} -- number of times up(s) was executed
  \textbf{npdown(s)} -- number of times down(s) was passed

  Then we define down and up:\\
  \textbf{down(s)}: ndown(s) = ndown(s)+1:
  if ndown(s) <= nup(s) + C(s) then npdown(s) = npdown(s) + 1;\\
  \textbf{up(s)}: if ndown(s) > nup(s) + C(s)
  then npdown(s) = npdown(s) + 1; nup(s) = nup(s)+1;
  \begin{theorem}
    npdown(s) = min(ndown(s), C(s) + nup(s))
  \end{theorem}

  \subsection{Multidimensional Semaphores of Agerwala}
  \textbf{edown($s1, \dots, s_n, s_{n+1}, \dots, s_{n+m}$}:
  if for all $i, 1 \leq i \leq n, s_i > 0$ and for all $j, 1 \leq j \leq m, S_{n+j} = 0$
  then for all $i, 1 \leq i \leq n, s_i = s_i - 1$
  else block execution of calling processes

  \textbf{eup($s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$}:
  if processes blocked on ($s_1, \dots, s_n$)
  then awaken al of them
  else for all $i, i \leq i \leq n, s_i = s_i + 1$

  \subsection{Inhibitor Nets}
  Add a circle to the transition side of an arc to make it an inhibitor arc
  Now the transition can only be fired if the places connected by inhibitor arcs are empty.

  \subsection{Smokers' Problem}
  3 Smokers each have an unlimited type of either tobacco, cigarette paper, matches.
  2 ingredients are placed on the table, the smoker with the third ingredient needed should pick up the ingredients, make a cigarette, and smoke it.
  Next set of ingredients won't be placed until smoking is completed.

  \section{Safety and Liveness}
  \textbf{Safety} -- asserts that nothing bad happens

  \textbf{Safety Property} $P$ -- defines a process that asserts any trace including the actions in the alphabet of $P$ is accepted by $P$, otherwise they are transitions to the ERROR state, safety checks are compositional hence they should be composed with the appropriate (sub)system

  \textbf{Liveness} -- asserts that something good eventually happens

  \textbf{Progress Property} -- asserts that it is always the case that a particular action is eventually executed, opposite of starvation, progress checks are not compositional hence they should be conducted after safety checks

  \textbf{Starvation} -- situation in which an action is never executed

  \textbf{Terminal Set of States} -- set of states in which every state is reachable from every other state in the set and there is no transition from within to set to any state outside the set

  \textbf{Priority} -- specifies actions that have a higher/lower priority than any other action in the alphabet of some state

  \section{CTL and LTL}

  \subsection{CTL}
  \textbf{A}: along all paths\\
  \textbf{E}: exists a path\\
  \textbf{X}: next state\\
  \textbf{F}: some future state\\
  \textbf{G}: all future states\\
  \textbf{U}: until (``killer" event must happen)\\
  \textbf{W}: weak until (``killer" event may never happen). \\
  % Janicki said "R" in LTL is not important, hint doc says no CTL* - Bani 
  In CTL, must start with path operator (A/E). W in CTL: $A[p\W q]\equiv A[p\U q]\lor \AG p$ (same with E).

  \textbf{Common Pattenrs}
  $AX\phi$ - in every next state.\\
  $EX\phi$ - in some next state.\\
  $AG\phi$ - All computation paths beginning with $s$ the property $\phi$ holds Globally.\\
  $EG\phi$ - There Exists a path beginning in $s$ such that $\phi$ holds Globally along the path.\\

  \section{Dynamic Systems}
  \subsection{Golf Club Program}
  Players at a golf club borrow and then return golf balls. Different players need different numbers of balls. How do we model the infinite stream of players? We can only model infinite behaviours.
  % Is there an example associated with this?

  \subsection{Adverse Scheduling}
  Intentionally schedule priorities to try to break things

  Eg for golf club scheduling:
  \begin{lstlisting}
progress NOVICE = {NOVICES.get[R]}
progress EXPERT = {EXPERTS.get[R]}
||ProgressCheck = GOLFCLUB >> {Players.put[R]}.
\end{lstlisting}

  % todo: add master-slave stuff
  \section{Q7 - A1}
  \begin{lstlisting}
P = (a -> b -> d -> P).
Q = (c -> b -> e -> Q).
||S1 = (P || Q).

S2 = (a -> S2A | c -> S2B),
S2A = (c -> b -> d -> S2C | c -> b -> e -> S2D),
S2B = (a -> b -> d -> S2C | a -> b -> e -> S2D),
S2C = (e -> S2 | a -> e -> S2A),
S2D = (d -> S2 | c -> d -> S2B).
\end{lstlisting}
  For the above FSPs, they both share the same LTS diagram (LTS version of the right petri net), however, since $||$S1 has simultaneous actions, its petri net will be show simultaneity whereas S2 will not.
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{A1Q7.png}

  \section{Q5 - Midterm}
  A central computer is connected to remote terminals, with seats for concert hall. Clients choose a free seat and clerk enters the seat into the system and gives a ticket. We need to prevent double booking while letting clients choose any available seat.
  \begin{lstlisting}
const False = 0
const True = 1
range Bool = False..True

SEAT = SEAT[False],
SEAT[reserved:Bool]
    = ( reserve -> SEAT[True]
      | query[reserved] -> SEAT[reserved]
      | when (reserved) reserve -> ERROR // error of reserved twice
      ).

range Seats = 0..1
||SEATS = (seat[Seats]:SEAT).

LOCK = (acquire -> release -> LOCK).

TERMINAL = (choose[s:Seats] -> acquire
            -> seat[s].query[reserved:Bool]
            -> (when(!reserved)seat[s].reserve -> release -> TERMINAL
            | when(reserved) release -> TERMINAL)
            ).

set Terminals = {a, b}
||CONCERT = (Terminals:TERMINAL || Terminals::SEATS || Terminals::LOCK).
\end{lstlisting}

  \section{Q7 - Midterm}
  \begin{lstlisting}
P1 = (a -> b -> c -> P1 | a -> c -> b -> P1).
P2 = (a -> (b -> c -> P2 | c -> b -> P2)).
Q = (b -> c -> Q).

||P1Q = (P1 || Q).
||P2Q = (P2 || Q).
\end{lstlisting}
  For P1 there are two possible paths which have an $a$ transition. For P2, it starts with one $a$ transition, so both the starting states are equivalent in this case. In both branches of P1, you either do $b \rightarrow c \rightarrow P1$  or $c \rightarrow b \rightarrow P1$. For P2, it splits into two possible paths, $b \rightarrow c \rightarrow P2$ or $c \rightarrow b \rightarrow P2$, which is the same as the traces for P1. Therefore P1 and P2 are equivalent. \\
  For $||$P1Q and $||$P2Q,both P1 and Q, and P2 and Q, share $b \rightarrow c$. In P1 and Q, this becomes a shared action and both P1 and Q will want to use the same transitions at the same time (deadlock). For $||$P2Q, the FSP can choose to go in the alternate direction instead of waiting for Q to finish, so this one would not have a deadlock whereas $||$P1Q will have one.

  \section{Alphabet Extension}
  \subsection{Processes}
  \begin{lstlisting}
P = (a -> b -> P).
Q = (c -> d -> Q).
Qa = (c -> d -> Q) + {b}.
\end{lstlisting}
  When taking the composition of $||$PQ and $||$PQa, we take the union of both processes and remove duplicate transitions. In the case of PQ, there are no similar transitions, however PQa shares the b transition, so that is removed from the LTS.
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{aep.png}

  \subsection{Properties}
  With properties, whenever you add more transitions through alphabet extension, you need to apply this transition to every state and use it as a transition to an error state.

  \section{Dining Savages}
  The dining savages: A tribe of savages eats communal dinners from a large pot capable of holding M servings of stewed missionaries. When a savage wants to eat, he helps himself from the pot unless it is empty, in which case he waits until the cook refills the pot. If the pot is empty, the cook refills the pot with M servings. The behavior of the savages and the cook is described by
  \begin{lstlisting}
SAVAGE = (get_serving->SAVAGE).
COOK = (fill_pot->COOK).
\end{lstlisting}
  Model the behaviour of the pot and of the system as FSP processes.
